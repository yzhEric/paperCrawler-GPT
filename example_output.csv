CVPR,2022,Interactive Image Synthesis With Panoptic Layout Generation,"Bo Wang, Tao Wu, Minfeng Zhu, Peng Du","Interactive image synthesis from user-guided input is a challenging task when users wish to control the scene structure of a generated image with ease. Although remarkable progress has been made on layout-based image synthesis approaches, existing methods require high-precision inputs such as accurately placed bounding boxes, which might be constantly violated in an interactive setting. When placement of bounding boxes is subject to perturbation, layout-based models suffer from ""missing regions"" in the constructed semantic layouts and hence undesirable artifacts in the generated images. In this work, we propose Panoptic Layout Generative Adversarial Network (PLGAN) to address this challenge. The PLGAN employs panoptic theory which distinguishes object categories between ""stuff"" with amorphous boundaries and ""things"" with well-defined shapes, such that stuff and instance layouts are constructed through separate branches and later fused into panoptic layouts. In particular, the stuff layouts can take amorphous shapes and fill up the missing regions left out by the instance layouts. We experimentally compare our PLGAN with state-of-the-art layout-based models on the COCO-Stuff, Visual Genome, and Landscape datasets. The advantages of PLGAN are not only visually demonstrated but quantitatively verified in terms of inception score, Frechet inception distance, classification accuracy score, and coverage.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Wang_Interactive_Image_Synthesis_With_Panoptic_Layout_Generation_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf,panoptic
CVPR,2021,How2Sign: A Large-Scale Multimodal Dataset for Continuous American Sign Language,"Amanda Duarte, Shruti Palaskar, Lucas Ventura, Deepti Ghadiyaram, Kenneth DeHaan, Florian Metze, Jordi Torres, Xavier Giro-i-Nieto","One of the factors that have hindered progress in the areas of sign language recognition, translation, and production is the absence of large annotated datasets. Towards this end, we introduce How2Sign, a multimodal and multiview continuous American Sign Language (ASL) dataset, consisting of a parallel corpus of more than 80 hours of sign language videos and a set of corresponding modalities including speech, English transcripts, and depth. A three-hour subset was further recorded in the Panoptic studio enabling detailed 3D pose estimation. To evaluate the potential of How2Sign for real-world impact, we conduct a study with ASL signers and show that synthesized videos using our dataset can indeed be understood.

CVPR,2022,PanopticDepth: A Unified Framework for Depth-Aware Panoptic Segmentation,"Naiyu Gao, Fei He, Jian Jia, Yanhu Shan, Haoyang Zhang, Xin Zhao, Kaiqi Huang","This paper presents a unified framework for depth-aware panoptic segmentation (DPS), which aims to reconstruct 3D scene with instance-level semantics from one single image. Prior works address this problem by simply adding a dense depth regression head to panoptic segmentation (PS) networks, resulting in two independent task branches. This neglects the mutually-beneficial relations between these two tasks, thus failing to exploit handy instance-level semantic cues to boost depth accuracy while also producing sub-optimal depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework for the DPS task by applying a dynamic convolution technique to both the PS and depth prediction tasks. Specifically, instead of predicting depth for all pixels at a time, we generate instance-specific kernels to predict depth and segmentation masks for each instance. Moreover, leveraging the instance-wise depth estimation scheme, we add additional instance-level depth cues to assist with supervising the depth learning via a new depth loss. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes-DPS and SemKITTI-DPS show the effectiveness and promise of our method. We hope our unified solution to DPS can lead a new paradigm in this area.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Gao_PanopticDepth_A_Unified_Framework_for_Depth-Aware_Panoptic_Segmentation_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf,panoptic
CVPR,2022,Panoptic SegFormer: Delving Deeper Into Panoptic Segmentation With Transformers,"Zhiqi Li, Wenhai Wang, Enze Xie, Zhiding Yu, Anima Anandkumar, Jose M. Alvarez, Ping Luo, Tong Lu","Panoptic segmentation involves a combination of joint semantic segmentation and instance segmentation, where image contents are divided into two types: things and stuff. We present Panoptic SegFormer, a general framework for panoptic segmentation with transformers. It contains three innovative components: an efficient deeply-supervised mask decoder, a query decoupling strategy, and an improved post-processing method. We also use Deformable DETR to efficiently process multi-scale features, which is a fast and efficient version of DETR. Specifically, we supervise the attention modules in the mask decoder in a layer-wise manner. This deep supervision strategy lets the attention modules quickly focus on meaningful semantic regions. It improves performance and reduces the number of required training epochs by half compared to Deformable DETR. Our query decoupling strategy decouples the responsibilities of the query set and avoids mutual interference between things and stuff. In addition, our post-processing strategy improves performance without additional costs by jointly considering classification and segmentation qualities to resolve conflicting mask overlaps. Our approach increases the accuracy 6.2% PQ over the baseline DETR model. Panoptic SegFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO test-dev with 56.2% PQ. It also shows stronger zero-shot robustness over existing methods.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Li_Panoptic_SegFormer_Delving_Deeper_Into_Panoptic_Segmentation_With_Transformers_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf,panoptic

Our approach aims to represent and predict foreground things and background stuff in a unified fully convolutional pipeline. In particular, Panoptic FCN encodes each object instance or stuff category into a specific kernel weight with the proposed kernel generator and produces the prediction by convolving the high-resolution feature directly. With this approach, instance-aware and semantically consistent properties for things and stuff can be respectively satisfied in a simple generate-kernel-then-segment workflow. Without extra boxes for localization or instance separation, the proposed approach outperforms previous box-based and -free models with high efficiency on COCO, Cityscapes, and Mapillary Vistas datasets with single scale input.

Schwing, Alexander Kirillov, Rohit Girdhar","Image segmentation groups pixels with different semantics, e.g., category or instance membership. Each choice of semantics defines a task. While only the semantics of each task differ, current research focuses on designing specialized architectures for each task. We present Masked-attention Mask Transformer (Mask2Former), a new architecture capable of addressing any image segmentation task (panoptic, instance or semantic). Its key components include masked attention, which extracts localized features by constraining cross-attention within predicted mask regions. In addition to reducing the research effort by at least three times, it outperforms the best specialized architectures by a significant margin on four popular datasets.

Schwing","Forecasting of a representation is important for safe and effective autonomy. For this, panoptic segmentations have been studied as a compelling representation in recent work. However, recent state-of-the-art on panoptic segmentation forecasting suffers from two issues: first, individual object instances are treated independently of each other; second, individual object instance forecasts are merged in a heuristic manner. To address both issues, we study a new panoptic segmentation forecasting model that jointly forecasts all object instances in a scene using a transformer model based on 'difference attention.' It further refines the predictions by taking depth estimates into account. We evaluate the proposed model on the Cityscapes and AIODrive datasets. We find difference attention to be particularly suitable for forecasting because the difference of quantities like locations enables a model to explicitly reason about velocities and acceleration. Because of this, we attain state-of-the-art on panoptic segmentation forecasting metrics.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Graber_Joint_Forecasting_of_Panoptic_Segmentations_With_Difference_Attention_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf,panoptic

It rethinks the existing transformer architectures used in segmentation and detection; CMT-DeepLab considers the object queries as cluster centers, which fill the role of grouping the pixels when applied to segmentation. The clustering is computed with an alternating procedure, by first assigning pixels to the clusters by their feature affinity, and then updating the cluster centers and pixel features. Together, these operations comprise the Clustering Mask Transformer (CMT) layer, which produces cross-attention that is denser and more consistent with the final segmentation task. CMT-DeepLab improves the performance over prior art significantly by 4.4% PQ, achieving a new state-of-the-art of 55.7% PQ on the COCO test-dev set.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Yu_CMT-DeepLab_Clustering_Mask_Transformers_for_Panoptic_Segmentation_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf,panoptic
CVPR,2021,Learning To Associate Every Segment for Video Panoptic Segmentation,"Sanghyun Woo, Dahun Kim, Joon-Young Lee, In So Kweon","Temporal correspondence -- linking pixels or objects across frames -- is a fundamental supervisory signal for the video models. For the panoptic understanding of dynamic scenes, we further extend this concept to every segment. Specifically, we aim to learn coarse segment-level matching and fine pixel-level matching together. We implement this idea by designing two novel learning objectives. To validate our proposals, we adopt a deep siamese model and train the model to learn the temporal correspondence on two different levels (i.e., segment and pixel) along with the target task. At inference time, the model processes each frame independently without any extra computation and post-processing. We show that our per-frame inference model can achieve new state-of-the-art results on Cityscapes-VPS and VIPER datasets.

CVPR,2021,UP-DETR: Unsupervised Pre-Training for Object Detection With Transformers,"Zhigang Dai, Bolun Cai, Yugeng Lin, Junying Chen","Object detection with transformers (DETR) reaches competitive performance with Faster R-CNN via a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Inspired by the great success of pre-training transformers in natural language processing, we propose a pretext task named random query patch detection to Unsupervisedly Pre-train DETR (UP-DETR) for object detection. Specifically, we randomly crop patches from the given image and then feed them as queries to the decoder. The model is pre-trained to detect these query patches from the original image. During the pre-training, we address two critical issues: multi-task learning and multi-query localization. (1) To trade off classification and localization preferences in the pretext task, we freeze the CNN backbone and propose a patch feature reconstruction branch which is jointly optimized with patch detection. (2) To perform multi-query localization, we introduce UP-DETR from single-query patch and extend it to multi-query patches with object query shuffle and attention mask.

CVPR,2022,Slot-VPS: Object-Centric Representation Learning for Video Panoptic Segmentation,"Yi Zhou, Hui Zhang, Hana Lee, Shuyang Sun, Pingjun Li, Yangguang Zhu, ByungIn Yoo, Xiaojuan Qi, Jae-Joon Han","Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS) aims at assigning a class label to each pixel, uniquely segmenting and identifying all object instances consistently across all frames. Classic solutions usually decompose the VPS task into several sub-tasks and utilize multiple surrogates (e.g. boxes and masks, centers and offsets) to represent objects. However, this divide-and-conquer strategy requires complex post-processing in both spatial and temporal domains and is vulnerable to failures from surrogate tasks. In this paper, inspired by object-centric learning which learns compact and robust object representations, we present Slot-VPS, the first end-to-end framework for this task. We encode all panoptic entities in a video, including both foreground instances and background semantics, in a unified representation called panoptic slots. The coherent spatio-temporal object's information is retrieved and encoded into the panoptic slots by the proposed Video Panoptic Retriever, enabling to localize, segment, differentiate, and associate objects in a unified manner. Finally, the output panoptic slots can be directly converted into the class, mask, and object ID of panoptic objects in the video. We conduct extensive ablation studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmark datasets, Cityscapes-VPS (val and test sets) and VIPER (val set), achieving new state-of-the-art performance of 63.7, 63.3 and 56.2 VPQ, respectively.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Zhou_Slot-VPS_Object-Centric_Representation_Learning_for_Video_Panoptic_Segmentation_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf,panoptic
CVPR,2022,"Panoptic, Instance and Semantic Relations: A Relational Context Encoder To Enhance Panoptic Segmentation","Shubhankar Borse, Hyojin Park, Hong Cai, Debasmit Das, Risheek Garrepalli, Fatih Porikli","This paper presents a novel framework to integrate both semantic and instance contexts for panoptic segmentation. In existing works, it is common to use a shared backbone to extract features for both things (countable classes such as vehicles) and stuff (uncountable classes such as roads). This, however, fails to capture the rich relations among them, which can be utilized to enhance visual understanding and segmentation performance. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel Panoptic, Instance, and Semantic Relations (PISR) module to exploit such contexts. First, we generate panoptic encodings to summarize key features of the semantic classes and predicted instances. A Panoptic Relational Attention (PRA) module is then applied to the encodings and the global feature map from the backbone. It produces a feature map that captures 1) the relations across semantic classes and instances and 2) the relations between these panoptic categories and spatial features. PISR also automatically learns to focus on the more important instances, making it robust to the number of instances used in the relational attention module. Moreover, PISR is a general module that can be applied to any existing panoptic segmentation architecture. Through extensive evaluations on panoptic segmentation benchmarks like Cityscapes, COCO, and ADE20K, we show that PISR attains considerable improvements over existing approaches.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Borse_Panoptic_Instance_and_Semantic_Relations_A_Relational_Context_Encoder_To_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf,panoptic
CVPR,2021,LiDAR-Based Panoptic Segmentation via Dynamic Shifting Network,"Fangzhou Hong, Hui Zhou, Xinge Zhu, Hongsheng Li, Ziwei Liu","With the rapid advances of autonomous driving, it becomes critical to equip its sensing system with more holistic 3D perception. However, existing works focus on parsing either the objects (e.g. cars and pedestrians) or scenes (e.g. trees and buildings) from the LiDAR sensor. In this work, we address the task of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, which aims to parse both objects and scenes in a unified manner. As one of the first endeavors towards this new challenging task, we propose the Dynamic Shifting Network (DS-Net), which serves as an effective panoptic segmentation framework in the point cloud realm. In particular, DS-Net has three appealing properties: 1) strong backbone design. DS-Net adopts the cylinder convolution that is specifically designed for LiDAR point clouds. The extracted features are shared by the semantic branch and the instance branch which operates in a bottom-up clustering style. 2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We observe that commonly-used clustering algorithms like BFS or DBSCAN are incapable of handling complex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud distributions and varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient learnable clustering module, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions on-the-fly for different instances. 3) Consensus-driven Fusion. Finally, consensus-driven fusion is used to deal with the disagreement between semantic and instance predictions. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, we construct and curate benchmarks from two large-scale autonomous driving LiDAR datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DS-Net achieves superior accuracies over current state-of-the-art methods. Notably, we achieve 1st place on the public leaderboard of SemanticKITTI, outperforming 2nd place by 2.6% in terms of the PQ metric.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Hong_LiDAR-Based_Panoptic_Segmentation_via_Dynamic_Shifting_Network_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf,panoptic
CVPR,2021,Hierarchical Lovasz Embeddings for Proposal-Free Panoptic Segmentation,"Tommi Kerola, Jie Li, Atsushi Kanehira, Yasunori Kudo, Alexis Vallet, Adrien Gaidon","Panoptic segmentation brings together two separate tasks: instance and semantic segmentation. Although they are related, unifying them faces an apparent paradox: how to learn simultaneously instance-specific and category-specific (i.e. instance-agnostic) representations jointly. Hence, state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation methods use complex models with a distinct stream for each task. In contrast, we propose Hierarchical Lovasz Embeddings, per pixel feature vectors that simultaneously encode instance- and category-level discriminative information. We use a hierarchical Lovasz hinge loss to learn a low-dimensional embedding space structured into a unified semantic and instance hierarchy without requiring separate network branches or object proposals. Besides modeling instances precisely in a proposal-free manner, our Hierarchical Lovasz Embeddings generalize to categories by using a simple Nearest-Class-Mean classifier, including for non-instance """"stuff"""" classes where instance segmentation methods are not applicable. Our simple model achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing proposal-free panoptic segmentation methods on Cityscapes, COCO, and Mapillary Vistas.

The new quality measure displays several desirable characteristics like symmetry w.r.t. prediction/ground truth pairs and balanced responsiveness across scales, which makes it more suitable for segmentation evaluation than other boundary-focused measures like Trimap IoU and F-measure. Based on Boundary IoU, we update the standard evaluation protocols for instance and panoptic segmentation tasks by proposing the Boundary AP (Average Precision) and Boundary PQ (Panoptic Quality) metrics, respectively. Our experiments show that the new evaluation metrics track boundary quality improvements that are generally overlooked by current Mask IoU-based evaluation metrics.

We think this ability to forecast, i.e., to anticipate, is integral for the success of autonomous agents which need not only passively analyze an observation but also must react to it in real-time. Importantly, accurate forecasting hinges upon the chosen scene decomposition. We think that superior forecasting can be achieved by decomposing a dynamic scene into individual 'things' and background 'stuff'. Background 'stuff' largely moves because of camera motion, while foreground 'things' move because of both camera and individual object motion. Following this decomposition, we introduce panoptic segmentation forecasting. Panoptic segmentation forecasting opens up a middle-ground between existing extremes, which either forecast instance trajectories or predict the appearance of future image frames. To address this task we develop a two-component model: one component learns the dynamics of the background stuff by anticipating odometry, the other one anticipates the dynamics of detected things.

CVPR,2021,Cross-View Regularization for Domain Adaptive Panoptic Segmentation,"Jiaxing Huang, Dayan Guan, Aoran Xiao, Shijian Lu","Panoptic segmentation unifies semantic segmentation and instance segmentation which has been attracting increasing attention in recent years. On the other hand, most existing research was conducted under a supervised learning setup whereas domain adaptive panoptic segmentation which is critical in different tasks and applications is largely neglected. We design a domain adaptive panoptic segmentation network that exploits inter-style consistency and inter-task regularization for optimal domain adaptive panoptic segmentation. The inter-style consistency leverages geometric invariance across the same image of the different styles which ` fabricates' certain self-supervisions to guide the network to learn domain-invariant features. The inter-task regularization exploits the complementary nature of instance segmentation and semantic segmentation and uses it as a constraint for better feature alignment across domains. Extensive experiments over multiple domain adaptive panoptic segmentation tasks (e.g. synthetic-to-real and real-to-real) show that our proposed network achieves superior segmentation performance as compared with the state-of-the-art.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Huang_Cross-View_Regularization_for_Domain_Adaptive_Panoptic_Segmentation_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf,panoptic

Although this corporation shows the competitiveness in the point cloud, it inevitably alters and abandons the 3D topology and geometric relations. A natural remedy is to utilize the 3D voxelization and 3D convolution network. However, we found that in the outdoor point cloud, the improvement obtained in this way is quite limited. An important reason is the property of the outdoor point cloud, namely sparsity and varying density. Motivated by this investigation, we propose a new framework for the outdoor LiDAR segmentation, where cylindrical partition and asymmetrical 3D convolution networks are designed to explore the 3D geometric pattern while maintaining these inherent properties. Moreover, a point-wise refinement module is introduced to alleviate the interference of lossy voxel-based label encoding. We evaluate the proposed model on two large-scale datasets , i.e., SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. Our method achieves the 1st place in the leaderboard of SemanticKITTI and outperforms existing methods on nuScenes with a noticeable margin.

The method is built upon K-Net, a method that unifies image segmentation via a group of learnable kernels. We observe that these learnable kernels from K-Net, which encode object appearances and contexts, can naturally associate identical instances across video frames. Motivated by this observation, Video K-Net learns to simultaneously segment and track ""things"" and ""stuff"" in a video with simple kernel-based appearance modeling and cross-temporal kernel interaction. Despite the simplicity, it achieves state-of-the-art video panoptic segmentation results on Citscapes-VPS and KITTI-STEP without bells and whistles.

CVPR,2022,Amodal Panoptic Segmentation,"Rohit Mohan, Abhinav Valada","Humans have the remarkable ability to perceive objects as a whole, even when parts of them are occluded. This ability of amodal perception forms the basis of our perceptual and cognitive understanding of our world. To enable robots to reason with this capability, we formulate and propose a novel task that we name amodal panoptic segmentation. The goal of this task is to simultaneously predict the pixel-wise semantic segmentation labels of the visible regions of stuff classes and the instance segmentation labels of both the visible and occluded regions of thing classes. To facilitate research on this new task, we extend two established benchmark datasets with pixel-level amodal panoptic segmentation labels that we make publicly available as KITTI-360-APS and BDD100K-APS.

Yet, only a few LiDAR-based 3D object detection methods leverage segmentation information to further guide the detection process. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task framework that jointly performs 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation. In our method, the 3D object detection backbone, which is in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) plane, is augmented by the injection of Range-View (RV) feature maps from the 3D panoptic segmentation backbone. This enables the detection backbone to leverage multi-view information to address the shortcomings of each projection view. Furthermore, foreground semantic information is incorporated to ease the detection task by highlighting the locations of each object class in the feature maps. Finally, a new center density heatmap generated based on the instance-level information further guides the detection backbone by suggesting possible box center locations for objects in the BEV plane. Our method works with any BEV-based 3D object detection method, and as shown by extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, it provides significant performance gains.

Different from raster images, CAD drawings are vector graphics consisting of geometric primitives such as segments, arcs, and circles. By treating each CAD drawing as a graph, we propose a novel graph attention network GAT-CADNet to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem: vertex features derived from the GAT branch are mapped to semantic labels, while their attention scores are cascaded and mapped to instance prediction. Our key contributions are three-fold: 1) the instance symbol spotting task is formulated as a subgraph detection problem and solved by predicting the adjacency matrix; 2) a relative spatial encoding (RSE) module explicitly encodes the relative positional and geometric relation among vertices to enhance the vertex attention; 3) a cascaded edge encoding (CEE) module extracts vertex attentions from multiple stages of GAT and treats them as edge encoding to predict the adjacency matrix. The proposed GAT-CADNet is intuitive yet effective and manages to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem in one consolidated network.

CVPR,2022,CADTransformer: Panoptic Symbol Spotting Transformer for CAD Drawings,"Zhiwen Fan, Tianlong Chen, Peihao Wang, Zhangyang Wang","Understanding 2D computer-aided design (CAD) drawings plays a crucial role for creating 3D prototypes in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries. The task of automated panoptic symbol spotting, i.e., to spot and parse both countable object instances (windows, doors, tables, etc.) and uncountable stuff (wall, railing, etc.) from CAD drawings, has recently drawn interests from the computer vision community. Unfortunately, the highly irregular ordering and orientations set major roadblocks for this task. Existing methods, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and/or graph neural networks (GNNs), regress instance bounding boxes in the pixel domain and then convert the predictions into symbols. In this paper, we present a novel framework named CADTransformer, that can painlessly modify existing vision transformer (ViT) backbones to tackle the above limitations for the panoptic symbol spotting task. CADTransformer tokenizes directly from the set of graphical primitives in CAD drawings, and correspondingly optimizes line-grained semantic and instance symbol spotting altogether by a pair of prediction heads. The backbone is further enhanced with a few plug-and-play modifications, including a neighborhood aware self-attention, hierarchical feature aggregation, and graphic entity position encoding, to bake in the structure prior while optimizing the efficiency. Besides, a new data augmentation method, termed Random Layer, is proposed by the layer-wise separation and recombination of a CAD drawing. Overall, CADTransformer significantly boosts the previous state-of-the-art from 0.595 to 0.685 in the panoptic quality (PQ) metric, on the recently released FloorPlanCAD dataset. We further demonstrate that our model can spot symbols with irregular shapes and arbitrary orientations.

Guibas, Andrea Tagliasacchi, Frank Dellaert, Thomas Funkhouser","We present PanopticNeRF, an object-aware neural scene representation that decomposes a scene into a set of objects (things) and background (stuff). Each object is represented by a separate MLP that takes a position, direction, and time and outputs density and radiance. The background is represented by a similar MLP that also outputs semantics. Importantly, the object MLPs are specific to each instance and initialized with meta-learning, and thus can be smaller and faster than previous object-aware approaches, while still leveraging category-specific priors. We propose a system to infer the PanopticNeRF representation from a set of color images. We use off-the-shelf algorithms to predict camera poses, object bounding boxes, object categories, and 2D image semantic segmentations. Then we jointly optimize the MLP weights and bounding box parameters using analysis-by-synthesis with self-supervision from the color images and pseudo-supervision from predicted semantic segmentations. PanopticNeRF can be effectively used for multiple 2D and 3D tasks like 3D scene editing, 3D panoptic reconstruction, novel view and semantic synthesis, 2D panoptic segmentation, and multiview depth prediction.

For the high-level features, we propose Recursive Atrous Self-Attention (RASA), which utilizes the multi-scale context when calculating the similarity map and a recursive mechanism to increase the representation capability with marginal extra parameter cost.

To this end, we present an efficient single-stage solution, Decoupled Regression Model (DRM), with three distinct novelties. First, DRM introduces a new decoupled representation for 3D pose, which expresses the 2D pose in image plane and depth information of each 3D human instance via 2D center point (center of visible keypoints) and root point (denoted as pelvis), respectively. Second, to learn better feature representation for the human depth regression, DRM introduces a 2D Pose-guided Depth Query Module (PDQM) to extract the features in 2D pose regression branch, enabling the depth regression branch to perceive the scale information of instances. Third, DRM leverages a Decoupled Absolute Pose Loss (DAPL) to facilitate the absolute root depth and root-relative depth estimation, thus improving the accuracy of absolute 3D pose.

This leads to a simplified pipeline with enhanced efficiency. In addition, DAS learns the true distribution of body joints for the regression of their positions, rather than making a simple Laplacian or Gaussian assumption as previous works. This provides valuable priors for model prediction and thus boosts the regression-based scheme to achieve competitive performance with volumetric-base ones. Moreover, DAS exploits a recursive update strategy for progressively approaching to regression target, alleviating the optimization difficulty and further lifting the regression performance.
